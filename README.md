# Train Car

This repo contains the files needed to print a little train car to put some lego guys in. The car with wheels prints as one object. No assembly is required.

The designs were originally made with OpenSCAD. The STL renders are also provided so you don't have to install OpenSCAD yourself.


### Printing tips

- Make sure your printer is dialed in and your filament is dry. If there's too much stringing or overextrusion, the axles will stick to the body.
- Pick a Z seam alignment that puts the seam on the bottom of the axle holes. The smoother the top of the holes for the axles, the better the wheels will spin.
- Print with tree supports touching the build plate. I use around a 60 degree overhang angle for supports.
